## Idea

As a fresher and due to online mode , one of the challenges  was knowing about the clubs and events being organised around the institute. Also we rely a lot on whatsapp groups to share event details, which is unorganised can become  spammy, missing important updates.
So to tackle all of this, we have developed BIT Clubs !
  

A platform for students of BIT and itâ€™s club, where one can find everything related to a club and stay updated about new events. 

## Achievements 

- **Effcient Lazy loading / infinite Scroll**
    - First query and load first few documents from database and loads more when user scrolls, thus saving user's data usage & server cost. It's also memory efficient as it loads only the item on focus, ( flatlist )
- **Authentication**
    - User can login / SignUp 
    - forget password
    - Anonymous login
 
- **Dynamic Content**
    - Instead of relying on static content, our app fetches , cache and renders content from database.
    - Markdown renderer for additional content
- **Newsroom**
    - New event updates 
    - Event details
    - 1 click Event join

- **Posts CRUD**
    - Admins can create, update, delete event posts.

- **Organisation pages**
    - list of all clubs
    - club details 
    - **MarkDown** for  additional content 
- **User Profiles**
    - Admin profile for admins
    - Student profile for rest users    
- **Platform Specific code **
    - different stylesheet for android, ios, web
