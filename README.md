As a fresher and due to online mode , one of the challenges  was knowing about the clubs and events being organised around the institute. Also we rely a lot on whatsapp groups to share event details, which is unorganised can become  spammy, missing important updates.
So to tackle all of this, we have developed BIT Clubs !
  

A platform for students of BIT and itâ€™s club, where one can find everything related to a club and stay updated about new events.
