## At IEEE, we believe in disseminating what we know and learning what we don't.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a non-profit professional association headquartered in New York City is dedicated to advancing technological innovation. Founded on 1st January 1963, IEEE is the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) (the institute with prominent scientist members such as Thomas Alva Edison and Nikola Tesla) and Institute of Radio Engineers(IRE). IEEE is one of the leading standard making organization in the field of electrical, electronics, telecommunication and computing industry with over 1100 standards active standards. 

IEEE Student Branch BIT Mesra believes in a constant endeavour to inculcate among students the requisite knowledge to catch up with their peers across the global community. The club ensures this through quality workshops on contemporary topics and through events which are aimed at sharpening cognition among participants and organizers alike.A great combination of students from different branches not only increases the diversity of the club but also helps one to explore different aspects of engineering and even increases the scope of their knowledge.

### To learn, we need to explore, discover, fail and be right.

 The event is mainly focused for newly joined freshers across all batches and branches. The event aims at learn and practice with gradual efforts and continuos hardwork. The students are given different weekly tasks to complete and build a project from what they learn. Along with the efforts of student they are also guided by personal mentors which accelerates the learning pace of the person.

## MegaProject
### A symposium to encourage students to make projects that have the capability to change something.

 The event was made open for students across all batches and branches. Students worked on a project in groups of at most three and then presented it in the symposium- the final project display round. The projects were from various domains like programming, robotics, graphics designing, etc. The best projects were given certificates and goodies to appreciate their efforts and encourage them.
